# FritzCallLogWidget
I like to have a list of the calls I get on my landline in widget format, thus I created this app after the deprecation and removal of the AVM Fritz!AppTicker. 
I modified dankitos FritzBox code so it uses username and password for the connection as this will be a must have with firmware >= 7.24 and the revised version is able to use myfritz.net to connect. 

Thanks to
